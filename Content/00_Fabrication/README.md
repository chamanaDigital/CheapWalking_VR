# Walking Structure

In the PDF file, you can find here the blueprints of the structure 
that helps you walk,we designed it thinking about a gladiator game, 
so must of the walls are not necessary for its primary function.
Which is to keep you in place when you slide your feet on the ground;
grabbing you by the waist with those big elastic bands for cars. 
We recommend also getting a carpenter to make it since some angles
are a bit steep to make it at home with enough preciseness.

# Electronics

I attached a diagram from sparkfun that tells you how to connect your
MPU6050 to a ESP32. 

I used:
* DOIT ESP32 DEVKIT v1 (you need to install the board in Arduino IDE)
* MPU6050 (gyroscope with accelerometer)
* Jumpers
* 2 mini breadboards (i will be posting a cnc file for the phenolic plate)
* 2 external batteries (i got a couple of $5 ones)

# Shoes

Used the sticky side from the breadboard to attach it to the tip of a shoe,
which in my case was a slipper covered in a sock to keed it in place. Then I
glued some acetate sheets in the shape of the sole (you can also use a piece
of hard plastic), which helps the feet slide on the carpet of the structure.

Here's a video from youtube where i got most of the measurements from in case
you're having a hard time following my lazy notes:
